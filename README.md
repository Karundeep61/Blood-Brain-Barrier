# Blood-Brain-Barrier
This project builds a computational model of the BBB using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and GPU acceleration. By combining biological principles with physics-based simulations, it aims to visualize and understand how different drugs cross (or fail to cross) the BBB and interact with brain tissue.
